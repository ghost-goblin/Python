## Variables
A variable is created from the moment you assign a value to it

```py
x = 5
y = "String"
print(x)
print(y)
```

> There are 4 built-in data types used to store _collections_ of data: **List**, **Tuple**, **Set**, & **Dictionary**.

## Lists
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

```py
mylist = ["orange", "pink", "green"]
```

## Tuples
A tuple is a collection of data which is ordered, unchangeable, and allows duplicate values.

```py
mytuple = ("orange", "pink", "green")
```

## Sets
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and **do not** allow duplicate values.

```py
myset = {"orange", "pink", "green"}
```

## Dictionaries
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates. They are presented in `key:value` pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```py
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
```

> Note: You can use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the `NumPy` library.
